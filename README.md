5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

my camera/lighting isn't good so the handtracker seems to get confused a lot like on my video

I wanted to implement photo details, like a caption that shows the location of where the images were taken, but they don't appear no matter what i tried! however, Ctrl-F after activating the details seems to find them perfectly.
